# Builders and Buyers: Startup Industry Analytics 

As I write this initial commit, I know one thing so far - we won't be using AI for content.
Everything I write in these files will be hand-curated and written by me, the old-school way.

We will use AI to write code and to design the frontend or build developer tools only. 

Builders and Buyers will be authentic, fresh and contain human-generated information.
